# FullStack Bad Banking Application-Capstone Project for MITxPro

This is my FullStack Bad Banking Application Capstone Project that has been fully refactored as a requirement and continuous learning process as a FullStack MERN Developer with MITxPRO.

## Description:
FullStack Bad Banking Application is the Capstone Project for MIT. It is called _Bad Bank due to the users data exposure and data leak directly from within the UI (intentionally per se).
